# An Embed URL Resolver

Hello! I'm Inside4ndroid, a passionate Software Developer. I love solving problems and here is a node implementation of a url resolver.

- ðŸ’¼ This will start off very small but will be a continued project and constantly updated with new hosts

# Suppported Hosts & Schema

These are non working urls and are only examples. Some of the url resolver links will return required headers like this :

`{"data":{"file":"playableurl","referer":"required to play url"}}`
